## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from everyone. To contribute:

1. **Create an Issue**: If you want to add new languages or concepts, create an issue first. Include the following details:

   - Name of the language or concept
   - Relevant topics or subtopics (e.g., data types, control structures)
   - Industry-level difficulty
   - Any specific focus areas (e.g., OOP principles, DSA)

2. **Branch and Structure**: Once the issue is approved:

   - Create a new branch named after the language or concept you’re contributing.
   - Organize the folder structure and files as per the repository guidelines.
   - Ensure the codebase and documentation are well-organized and clearly written.

3. **Pull Request**: After making your changes, submit a pull request. Ensure your PR includes:
   - Detailed description of the additions or changes
   - Any specific instructions or notes for reviewers

## Contribution Guidelines
